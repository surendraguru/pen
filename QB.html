                        <p class="ques">1. What is QBASIC? </p>
                        <P>Ans: A modular programming language, where program is divided in different modules or
                            functions is called QBASIC.</P>
                        <p class="ques">2. What is syntax?</p>
                        <p>Ans: The rule and grammar followed while writing statements, functions and variables in any
                            programming language is called syntax.</p>
                        <p class="ques">3. Define variable and constant.</p>
                        <p>Ans: A location in the memory, contents of which can be changed during program execution is
                            called Variable.</p>
                        <p>A symbol whose value does not change during program execution is called Constant .</p>
                        <p class="ques">4. What is operator?</p>
                        <p>Ans: Symbols, which are used for mathematical calculations, logical and string operations is
                            called operator.</p>
                        <p class="ques">5. What is relational operator?</p>
                        <p>Ans: Relational operator is symbol, which are used in relational or logical expressions.
                        <p class="ques">6. What is Logical operator?</p>
                        <p>Ans: Logical operators are symbols, which are used to combine two or more logical or
                            relational expressions and return a single true or false value.</p>
                        <p class="ques">7. What is looping?</p>
                        <p>Ans: A control structure that executes the same program statement or block of program
                            statements repeatedly for specified number of times or till the given condition is satisfied
                            is called Looping.</p>
                        <p class="ques">8. What is nested loop?</p>
                        <p>Ans: A loop within another loop is called nested loop.
                        <p class="ques">9. What is infinite loop
                        <p>Ans: Never terminating loop is called infinite loop.</p>
                        <p class="ques">10. What is array?</p>
                        <p>Ans: A collection of the data of similar type, all of which are referred by a single
                            variable name with different subscripts is called array.</p>
                        <p class="ques">11. Define user defined functions.</p>
                        <p>Ans: The function which is written and stored by the programmer to do the specific task is
                            called user defined functions. The programmer defines this type of function, if QBASIC does
                            not provide a built-in function to solve any problem required by the programmer. FUNCTION -
                            END FUNCTION statement can be used to define a user defined function.
                            Example: DECLARE FUNCTION SUM (NUM1,NUM2) .</p>
                        <p class="ques">12. Define built-in or Library Functions.</p>
                        <p>Ans: The functions provided by the QBASIC system is called built in or library functions.
                            They allow the programmer to use them according to the requirement. Built in functions
                            require to be called by the programmer to use them in a program. Example: LEN, MID$ etc.</p>
                        <p class="ques">13. Define modular Programming.</p>
                        <p>Ans: An approach in which the program is divided into separate independent units, called
                            modules to perform specific task is called modular programming.</p>
                        <p class="ques">14. Mention any two advantages of modular programming.</p>
                        <p>Ans: (i) Reducing redundancy of code (Code re-usability)
                            (ii) Saving time during project development</p>
                        <p class="ques">15. Why QBASIC is called modular programming language?</p>
                        <p>Ans: QBASIC is called modular programming language because it allows the user to divide
                            program into manageable and functional modules or blocks with the help of sub procedure and
                            function procedure.</p>
                        <p class="ques">16. Define Main module.</p>
                        <p>Ans: The top level module is called main module, which is located at the top of all
                            procedures such as sub procedures or function procedure. It is the entry point of modular
                            programming. Procedure name and parameters are declared and called from the main module.
                        <p class="ques">17. Define Sub Procedure.</p>
                        <p>Ans: A small manageable and functional part of a program that performs specific tasks and
                            does not return any value to the calling module is called Sub procedure.</p>
                        <p class="ques">18. What is the use of CALL statement.</p>
                        <p>Ans: The CALL statement transfers the control to sub procedure and statement in the sub
                            procedure execute. It is used to call or execute a sub procedure from the main module.
                        <p class="ques">19. Define arguments.</p>
                        <p>Ans: The constant or variables enclosed in the parenthesis of procedure call statement and
                            that are supplied to a procedure are called arguments. It is also known as actual parameter.
                            The argument can be passed to a procedure either by reference or by the value method.</p>
                        <p class="ques">20. Define parameters.</p>
                        <p>Ans: Variables in sub module or a procedure declaration which accept data or variables
                            passed to them from the calling module are called parameters. It is also known as formal
                            parameter.</p>
                        <p class="ques">21. Define Local Variable.</p>
                        <p>Ans: A variable which is defined in a module and is not accessible to any other modules is
                            called local variable. It is only accessible to the module where it is defined. Value of
                            local variable is destroyed when execution of module is over.</p>
                        <p class="ques">22. Define Global Variable.</p>
                        <p>Ans: A variable in main module which can be accessed from any modules or procedure of a
                            program is called global variable. Variable can be made global declaring them with DIM
                            SHARED or COMMON SHARED or SHARED attribute.</p>
                        <p class="ques">23. Write about Passing argument by reference.</p>
                        <p>Ans: Arguments are normally passed to a sub program by reference, which gives the procedure
                            access to the actual variable. In this method, the address of each variable is passed to the
                            procedure. The changes made in the procedure's variable they will make change in the value
                            of arguments. It is the default mode of passing arguments in QBASIC. Example: CALL TEST
                            (A,B)</p>
                        <p class="ques">24. Write about Passing argument by value.</p>
                        <p>Ans: Argument passed by the value method does not make any effect to value of the variables
                            which are passed to a procedure even they are changed in the procedure. When arguments are
                            passed by value method, it makes a duplicate copy of arguments and their values are used
                            directly in the parameters. The changes made in the procedure's variable they does not make
                            any change in the value of arguments. To pass argument by value method each argument is
                            enclosed in individual parentheses in the calling statement. Example: CALL TEST ( (A) , (B)
                            )</p>
                        <p class="ques">25. Define procedure.</p>
                        <p>Ans: A collection of code which perform an action is called procedure.</p>
                        <p class="ques">26. Mention the types of procedure.</p>
                        <p>Ans: (i) Sub procedure (ii) Function procedure</p>
                        <p class="ques">27. List any two advantages of procedure.</p>
                        <p>Ans: (i) It divides big program into small manageable module , makes easy to debug.
                            (ii) It reduces the program codes because a single module can be used in different places.
                        </p>
                        <p class="ques">28. Differentiate between Function and Sub procedure.</p>
                        <p>Ans:</p>
                        <p> Function Procedure
                            (i) It returns value. (ii) It does not use call statement. </p>
                        <p> Sub Procedures (i) It does not return value.
                            (ii) It uses call statement.</p>

                        <p>There are two types of files that can be created and handled in QBASIC.</p>

                            handling.</p>
                        <p><span class="red"> Sequential Access to a data files: </span> means that the computer system
