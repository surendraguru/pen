                        <h4>E. Types / Generation of Programming Language</h4>
                        <p><b>A. Low Level Language</b>is machine-dependent (0s & 1s) programming language processes by
                            Processor directly without any language translators so, it can run very fast.
                            Low-level language is further divided into two parts –
                            <br> i. Machine Language / First Generation
                            <br>ii. Assembly Language / Second Generation
                            <br><b>B. High Level Language</b><br>iii. Procedural-Oriented Language / 3rd Gen.
                            <br>iv. Problem-Oriented Language / 4th Gen.
                            <br>v. Natural Language / 5th Gen.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>1. Machine Language</b>is also called as machine code / object code / first Gen., normally
                            displayed in binary or hexadecimal form (base 16) form. It does not require a translator to
                            convert the programs because computers directly understand and process the instruction.
                            <br><b>Advantages:</b><br>a. It is translator free, can be directly executed by system
                            <br>b. It is faster in execution & efficiently utilizes memory because it is possible to
                            keep track of each bit of data.
                            <br><b>Disadvantages:</b><br>a. It is very difficult to understand and difficult and
                            complex to
                            develop program.
                            <br>b. It is machine dependent, so as per the architecture specification, it is specified,
                            costly &
                            difficult.
                            <br>c. Difficult to find the errors (bug), troubleshoot (debug) and modify the code.
                            <br>d. Reduce programming efficiency as difficult to remember instructions, code and
                            locations.
                        </p>
                        <p><br><b>2. Assembly Language: </b> It represents the set of instructions in a symbolic
                            notation
                            and human-understandable form to write programs. It uses an assembler to convert the
                            assembly
                            language to machine language. Assembly language instructions are represented as alphanumeric
                            symbolic codes known as mnemonics.
                            <br><b>Advantages:</b>
                            <br>- It requires less memory and less execution time to execute a program
                            <br>- Relatively easy to understand and use
                            <br>- Less error prone
                            <br>- More control on hardware
                            <br>- More efficient than high level language
                            <br><b>Disadvantages: </b>
                            <br>- Machine dependent
                            <br>- Difficult to learn
                            <br>- Takes more time to develop
                            <br>- Less efficient and slower than first generation
                            <br>- No support for modern software engineering technology:
                            <br>- No standardization

                            independent language. <br>The instructions in HLL, known as source program are transportable
                            but non-executable, it requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into
                            machine language. <br>
                            HLL is easy to learn, write and maintain. E.g. Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, LISP etc.
                            <br>Translator checks syntax, if syntax is correct, translates into equivalent machine codes
                            called object programs. If syntax error it generates error messages.
                            <br><b>Advantages:</b><br>- Easy and faster to program and debug

                        <h4>F. Language Translators/ Processors</h4>
                        <p><b>Language Translators:</b>, is a system software that translates source code from one
                            programming language to another and also identify errors during translation.
                            The process of converting a program written in a High-level or Assembly language into
                            machine languages is known as Decoding or Translating.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are three types of language processors: assembler, compiler, and interpreter.
                            <br><b> Interpreter:</b> translates & run single statement at a time into machine language.
                            <br><b> Compiler:</b> translates and run all instruction at one into machine language.
                            <br><b> Assembler:</b> a software that converts code of assembly language into machine
                            language.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Compiler</b>
                            <br>- Compiler translates whole program into machine code at a time
                            <br>- Compiler traps the errors before compiling the complete program
                            <br>- Compiling and execute process is incredibly faster
                            <br>- Intermediate object code is generated
                            <br>- Difficult to debug
                            <br>- Requires more memory
                            <br>- E.g. C, C++, Java.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Interpreter</b>
                            <br>- Interpreter translates single statement of a program at a time
                            <br>- Traps the errors before translating a line at a time
                            <br>- Translation process is slower
                            <br>- No intermediate object code is generated
                            <br>- Easy to code and debug
                            <br>- Requires less memory
                            <br>- E.g. BASIC, Visual Basic
                        </p>

                        <h4>G. Programming Errors: </h4>
                        <p><b>Programming Errors:</b> means an error or defect that occurs during the development
                            or encoding of a computer program, software, or application, which make abnormal behavior or
                            incorrect operation of a computer system.
                            <br> Programming errors are also known as the bugs or faults, and the process of removing
                            these
                            bugs is known as debugging.
                            <br> These errors are detected either during the time of compilation, execution or and
                            implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>Different common types of Programming Errors are: </b>
                            <br>1. Syntax error / Compilation errors
                            <br>2. Logical error
                            <br>3. Semantic error
                            <br>4. Run-time error
                            <br>5. Linker error
                            <br>6. Interface errors
                            <br>7. Resource errors etc.
                        </p>
                        <p><b>1. Syntax errors:</b>
                            <br>Syntax errors occur when code violates the rules of the programming language such as
                            missing semicolons, brackets, or wrong indentation of the code.
                            <br> These errors are generally made by beginners and can be easily debugged or corrected.
                            <br> Eg.: syntax errors:
                            <br> Int a = 5
                            <br> int 3 = b;
                            <br> printf( a is greater than b);
                            <br> Eg.: correct syntax
                            <br> int a = 5;
                            <br> int b = 3;
                            <br> printf("%d is greater than %d",a,b);
                        </p>
                        <p><b>2. Logical errors:</b>
                            Logical errors are the type of errors that occurs when incorrect logic is implemented in the
                            code and the code produces unexpected output.
                            <br> The occurrence of these errors mainly depends upon the logical thinking of the
                            developer.
                            <br> Eg.: Logical errors:
                            <br> for(a=1; a>=10; a++)
                            <br> Or
                            <br> for(a=1; a<=10; a--) <br> Eg.: correct syntax
                                <br> for(a=1; a<=10; a++) Or <br> for(a=1; a<=10; a++) </p>

                                        <p><b>3. Semantic errors:</b>
                                            Semantic errors are the errors that occurred when the statements are not
                                            understandable by the compiler or an user.
                                            <br> Due to semantic error (error in data statement), incorrect or
                                            unexpected
                                            output is produced.
                                            <br> Eg.: Semantic errors:
                                            <br> int a,b;
                                            <br> Avg=a+b/2;
                                            <br> printf("the average is %d",a);
                                            <br> Eg.: correct syntax
                                            <br> int a,b;
                                            <br> Avg=(a+b)/2;
                                            <br> printf("the average is %d",Avg);
                                        </p>

                                        <p><b>4. Run-time errors:</b>
                                            The errors exist during the execution-time even after the successful
                                            compilation known as run-time errors.
                                            These errors are very difficult to find, as the compiler does not point to
                                            these errors.
                                            <br> Eg.: Run-time errors:
                                            <br> int b=2/0;
                                            <br> printf("The value of b is : %d", b);
                                            <br> Eg.: correct syntax
                                            <br> int b=2;
                                            <br> printf("The value of b is : %d", b);
                                        </p>
                                        <p><b>5. Linker errors:</b>
                                            Linker errors are mainly generated when the executable file of the program
                                            is not created.
                                            <br> The most common linker error that occurs is that we use Main() instead
                                            of
                                            main().
                                            <br> Eg.: Run-time errors:
                                            <br> int Main() {
                                            <br> int a=78;
                                            <br> printf("The value of a is : %d", a);
                                            <br> Eg.: correct syntax
                                            <br> int main() {
                                            <br> int a=78;

                                <p>• C language provides us the way to hold any type of data for programming which is
                                    called
                                    data type. The data might be in the form of number, character, string, or record.
                                    <br> • Data type is an instruction that is used to declare the category of type of
                                    variable
                                    being
                                    used in the program. Any variable in program must be declared before using it. It
                                    determines
                                    the way a computer organizes data in memory.
                                    <br> • In C programming, data types are declarations for variables. This determines
                                    the
                                    type
                                    and
                                    size of data associated with variables.
                                    <br> • Data types in the c programming language are used to specify what kind of
                                    value
                                    can
                                    be
                                    stored in a variable. These are categorized into two categories. They are:

                        <h4>Variable:</h4>
                        <p><b>Variable:</b>Those entities which hold either numeric or alphanumeric values in a program
                            and may change its value throughout the time of program execution are known as variables. It
                            is the character set used store value temporarily.</p>
                        <p><b>Rule for writing variable:</b><br> • Variable names start with alphabet or underscore sign
                            only, it doesn't start with any number.
                            <br> • Variable names should not have blank space in between. Eg, first name is invalid,
                            firstname is valid
                            <br> • Keywords cannot be used as variable name. Eg, printf = 2; is invalid, num = 2; is
                            valid
                            <br> • Uppercase variable names are different from lowercase variable names. Eg, age = 2 is
                            different from AGE = 2 <br>
                            • Examples int a, sum, percentage, age etc.

                            (or both). Writing rules same as integer constant but / sign cannot be used. </p>
                        <p><b>Character constant:</b>is a single character, enclosed in apostrophes (single quotation
                            mark) e.g. ‘a’ ‘A’ ‘3’ </p>
                        <p><b>String constant: </b>is a set of characters enclosed in double quotation marks. E.g.
