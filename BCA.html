                            <p>1) C programming is the mostly used a general-purpose, procedural, imperative,
                                systematic
                                and structure

                            </p>
                            <p>2) C is considered as a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both
                                low-level (Assembly
                                language) and high-level languages.
                            </p>
                            <p>3) It can be defined by the following ways:<br>

                                e. Mid-level programming language<br>
                            </p>
                            <p>4) History of C: <br>
                                i. ALGOL-60 (ALGOrithmic Language):
                                • Discovered in 1960 at Cambridge University
                                • Used for algorithmic conversion as alternative for FORTRAN
                                • FORTRAN (FORmula TRANlation) <br>
                                ii. CPL (Combined Programming Language):
                                • Discovered in 1963 at Cambridge University
                                • It was used for general purpose
                                • It was hard to learn and difficult to implement. <br>
                                iii. BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language):
                                • Discovered in 1967 at Cambridge University by Martin Richard and his team
                                • BCPL was simplified version of CPL, but was so simple to solve specific problems
                                • PCPL was type less language<br>
                                iv. B Language:
                                • Discovered in 1969 at AT & T's Bell Laboratories by Ken Thompson
                                • Like BCPL, B also turns out to be very specific
                                • It was also type of Less language <br>
                                v. Traditional C Language:
                                • Discovered in 1972 at AT & T's Bell Laboratories by Dennis Richie,
                                • C contains data concept, and include features of BCPL & B
                                • C have features of previous generation and added more features <br>
                                vi. K and R C Language:
                                • Discovered in 1978 by Kernighan & Dennis Ritchie <br>
                                BCPL ("Basic Combined Programming Language") is a procedural, imperative, and
                                structured programming language developed by a British computer scientist Martin
                                Richards in 1966 by combining many features of different languages. <br>
                                • Kenneth Lane Thompson is an American pioneer of computer science, developer of B
                                language in 1969, worked at Bell Labs for most of his career where he and his
                                student
                                Dennis Ritchie designed and implemented the original Unix operating system.<br>
                                ANSI C, ISO C, and Standard C are successive standards for the C programming
                                language published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and<br>
                                International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International
                                Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).<br>
                                • The original and best-supported version of the standard, known as C89 or C90.

                                <br>- It makes program efficient and easy to read, modify.
                                <br> - It provides the ability for inclusion of header files, macro expansions,
                                conditional compilation & line control.
                                <br> - It follows special Syntax: begins with the hash symbol or pound character (#)
                                and
                                followed by respective preprocessor directive.
                                <br> - There are three types of preprocessor directives in C language.
                                <br> => Header file inclusive directive

                            <p><b>XML</b> is widely used in the era of web development. It is also used to simplify
                                data storage and data sharing.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>1. XML is an international standard: </b>XML is a document standard that is
                                maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), an organization that is
                                responsible for Web standards. XML documents are vendor-neutral, and they are not
                                tied to one application or one company. </p>
                            <p><b>2. It Separates Data from HTML: </b>If you need to display dynamic data in your
                                HTML document, it will take a lot of work to edit the HTML each time the data
                                changes. With XML, data can be stored in separate XML files. With a few lines of
                                JavaScript code, you can read and external XML files and update the data content of

                            <p><b>3. It Simplifies Data Sharing: </b>In the real world, computer systems and
                                databases contain data in incompatible formats. XML data is stored in plain text
                                format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing data. This
                                makes it much easier to create data that can be shared by different applications.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>4. XML Simplifies Data Transport: </b>One of the most time-consuming challenges
                                for developers is to exchange data between incompatible systems over the Internet.
                                Exchanging data as XML greatly reduces this complexity, since the data can be read
                                by different incompatible applications. </p>
                            <p><b>5. It Increases Data Available:</b>Different application can access XML data and
                                can be available to all kinds of “reading machines” (Handheld computers, voice
                                machines, news feeds, etc.) and make it more available for blind people, or people

                                languages are created with XML: such as
                                <br><u>XHTML:</u> combination of HTML and XML

                            <p>XML documents are formed as element trees. An XML tree starts at a root element and
                                branches from the root to child elements. The terms parent, child, and sibling are
                                used to describe the relationships between elements. <br>

                            <p><b>1) XML Declaration</b>The XML document can optionally have an XML declaration. It
                                is written as below:</P>
                            <p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding = "UTF-8" ? &gt;</p>
                            <p>This line is also called the XML prolog: Where version is the XML version and
                                encoding specifies the character encoding used in the document.</p>
                            <p><b>Rules for XML Declaration:</b><br>a) The XML declaration is case sensitive and
                                must begin with "
                                &lt;?xml>" where "xml" is written in lower-case.
                                <br>b) If document contains XML declaration, then it strictly needs to be the first
                                statement of the XML document.
                                <br>c) An HTTP protocol can override the value of encoding that you put in the XML
                                declaration.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>2) Tags and Elements</b><br>An XML file is structured by several XML-elements,
                                also
                                called XML-nodes or XML-tags. XML-elements' names are enclosed by triangular
                                brackets &lt; &gt; as shown below:<br>
                                &lt; element &gt;</p>
                            <p><b>Rules for Tags and Elements:</b><br>
                                a) Each XML-element needs to be closed either with start or with end elements as
                                shown below
                                &lt;element>....&lt;&frasl;element> or in simple-cases, just this way: &lt;element
                                &frasl;>
                                <br>b) There is no limitation and predefined element &frasl; tag name, we can use
                                our own value related name. E.g.: &lt; name> Surendra &lt; &frasl; name>
                                <br>c) If the XML declaration does not have a closing tag, this is not an error. The
                                declaration is not a part of XML.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Nesting of elements: </b>An XML-element can contain multiple XML-elements. </p>
                            <p><b>Case sensitivity: </b>The names of XML-elements are case-sensitive. That means the
                                name of the start and the end elements need to be exactly in the same case.</p>
                            <p><b>3) Attributes</b>
                                <br> An attribute specifies a single property for the element, using a name/value
                                pair.
                                An XML-element can have one or more attributes.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Rules for XML Attributes:</b><br>
                                a) Attribute names in XML are case sensitive. That is, HREF and href are considered
                                two different XML attributes.
                                <br>b) Attribute names are defined without quotation marks, whereas attribute values
                                must always appear in quotation marks.
                                <br>Eg. : &lt;name id= “1”>Surendra &lt; &frasl;name>
                            </p>
                            <P><b>4) XML References</b><br>References usually allow you to add or include additional
                                text or markup in an XML document. References always begin with the symbol "&",
                                which is a reserved character and end with the symbol ";". XML has two types of
                                references: </P>
                            <p><b>A. Entity References:</b>Some characters have a special meaning in XML. If you
                                place a character like "&lt;" inside an XML element, it will generate an error
                                because the parser interprets it as the start of a new element.
                                This will generate an XML error:
                                <br>&lt; message> Salary &lt; 1000 &lt; &frasl; message> <br> To avoid this error,
                                replace the "<" character with an entity reference: <br>There are 5 pre-defined
                                    entity
                                    references in XML: <br><img src="/images/charsymbol.JPG" alt=""><b>B. Character
                                        References: </b><br>These contain references, such as &#65;, contains a hash
                                    mark (“#”) followed by a number. The number always refers to the Unicode code of
                                    a character. In this case, 65 refers to alphabet "A".
                            </p>
                            <p><b>5) XML Text</b><br>The names of XML-elements and XML-attributes are
                                case-sensitive, which means the name of start and end elements need to be written in
                                the same case.
                                To avoid character encoding problems, all XML files should be saved as Unicode UTF-8
                                or UTF-16 files.
                                Whitespace characters like blanks, tabs and line-breaks between XML-elements and
                                between the XML-attributes will be ignored.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Comments in XML </b>The syntax for writing comments in XML is similar to that of

                            <p><b>A Namespace </b>is a set of unique names. Namespace is a mechanism by which
                                element
                                and attribute name can be assigned to group. The Namespace is identified by URI
                                (Uniform
                                Resource Identifiers). A Namespace is declared using reserved attributes. When using
                                prefixes in xml, a namespace for the prefix must be defined; xmlns : prefix = “URI”
                                shown as below:<br>
                                &lt;element xmlns:name="URL"> <br> e.g.: &lt;r : student xmlns : r =
                                “http://www.spt.com.np/xml/”> &lt;/r : student> <br>
                                Elements and attributes name along with namespace have exactly one colon.
                                Colon before text <b>prefix name</b> and colon after text <b>element or attribute
                                    name.</b><br>
                                The Namespace starts with the keyword xmlns.
                                The word name is the Namespace prefix, each prefix name is associated with one URI.
                                <br>
                                The URL is the Namespace identifier. Fully qualified name including prefix, colon is
                                called the XML qualified name.
                                XML data are exchanged between several applications, where may same tag name have
                                different meaning with different applications that make confusion on exchanging
                                documents. So, XML Namespaces is used to distinguish between duplicate elements and
                                attribute names.
                            </p>
                            <p>Namespace affects only a limited area in the document. An element containing the
                                declaration and all of its descendants are in the scope of the Namespace. Following

                            <h4>DTD (DOCUMENT TYPE DEFINITION) :</h4>
                            <p><b>The XML Document Type Declaration (DTD): </b>is a way to describe XML language
                                precisely. An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed". A DTD
                                defines
                                the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. DTDs check
                                vocabulary and validity of the structure of XML documents against
                                grammatical rules of appropriate XML language. It allows to create rules for the
                                elements within XML document. A DTD defines the document structure with a list of
                                legal
                                elements and attributes. Although XML itself has rules, the rules defined in a DTD
                                are
                                specific to your needs. <br> So, for an XML document to be well-formed, it needs to
                                use
                                correct XML syntax, and it
                                needs to conform to its DTD or schema.
                            </p>
                            <p><i>Note: if you have created your own XML elements, attributes and / or entities,
                                    then
                                    you should create a DTD but if you are creating using predefined elements/
                                    attributes/ entities then a DTD should already exist, and you need only link to
                                    that
                                    DTD using DOCTYPE declaration. </i></p>
                            <p><b>Basic syntax of a DTD is as follows:</b><br>&lt;!DOCTYPE element DTD identifier
                                <br>
                                [ <br>
                                declaration1 <br>
                                declaration2 <br>
                                ........ <br>
                                ]>
                            </p>
                            <p><b>In the above syntax,</b><br>1. The DTD starts with &lt;!DOCTYPE delimiter.
                                <br>2. An element tells the parser to parse the document from the specified root
                                element.
                                <br>3. DTD identifier is an identifier for the document type definition, which may
                                be
                                the path to a file on the system or URL to a file on the internet. If the DTD is
                                pointing to external path, it is called External Subset.
                                <br>4. The square brackets [ ] enclose an optional list of entity declarations
                                called
                                Internal Subset.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Advantages:</b><br>a. Compact and easy to use
                                <br>b. Can be defined outside/ inside XML document
                                <br>c. Widely used
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Disadvantages:</b><br>a. They lack some flexibility
                                <br>b. Not writing using XML syntax.
                                <br>c. No data type
                            </p>
                            <p><b>When NOT to Use a DTD?</b><br>XML does not require a DTD. <br>
                                When you are experimenting with XML, or when you are working with small XML files,
                                creating DTDs may be a waste of time. <br>
                                If you develop applications, wait until the specification is stable before you add a
                                DTD. Otherwise, your software might stop working because of validation errors.</p>

                            <p><b>Internal DTD</b><br>A DTD is referred to as an internal DTD if elements are

                                within the XML files. To refer it as internal DTD, standalone attribute in XML
                                declaration must be set to yes. This means, the declaration works independent of
                                external source. <br>
                                The syntax of internal DTD is as shown:

                                where root-element is the name of root element and element-declarations is where you
                                declare the elements. Example:

                                your DOCTYPE declaration. When you use the PUBLIC keyword, you also need to use an
                                FPI
                                (which stands for Formal Public Identifier). <br> FPI Syntax: <br>
                                An FPI is made up of 4 fields, each separated by double forward slashes (//): field

                            <p><b>Dynamic content</b> in the context of World Wide Web refers to website content that
                                constantly or regularly changes based on user interactions, timing and other parameters
                                that determine what content is delivered to the user. E.g. Facebook site, that delivers
                                dynamic content, as every user gets different content based on their friends and social
                                interactions, although the layout stays generally the same. This could be different
                                text, video, advertisements or even an entirely different layout and color. Dynamic
                                content allows websites to be individually adapted to their visitors. A site uses
                                variety of ways to detect significant user characteristics and matches its contents
                                accordingly.
                                <br><b>Advantages of Dynamic Content are:</b>
                                <br>&emsp;a. It is Personalize:
                                <br>&emsp; b. It is Extensible: it can tap into a variety of external resources
                                including
                                the local
                                file system, databases, or other server.
                                <br>&emsp; c. It is Interactive: provides content and allow to submit information to
                                server.
                                <br>&emsp; d. It is Seamless: can load dynamic content over an already-loaded content.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>There are two ways to provide dynamic content:</b></p>
                            <p><b>1. Using client-side scripting and frameworks</b> such as JavaScript, AJAX and
                                Bootstrap to
                                change the UI behavior within a specific Web page in response to specific user actions
                                and timings. This gives dynamic behavior to the UI presentation. This is normally used
                                in Web applications and interactive websites.
                                <br><b>2. Using server-side scripting and processing</b> to dynamically form both the
                                layout and
                                content to be delivered to the user based on parameters such as the user's location,
                                time of day, browser being used or user preferences. Some good examples of this are
                                social networking sites and content delivery sites. Social networking sites such as
                                Facebook and Twitter provide entirely different content per user because of the
                                difference of their connections and subscribed services, while sites like YouTube and
                                Amazon provide dynamic content based on user-specific preferences based on past
                                purchases or views; the server gives suggested items or content that the user may like
                                based on historical data.

                            <p><b>Dynamic Content</b> is a web-page or email component that changes based on user

                                variables) to be
                                used across multiple pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>6. Unlike a cookie, the information is not stored on the users computer. We all know that
                                the web uses the HTTP protocol and the HTTP protocol is a stateless protocol; in other
                                words, when a client sends a request to the server, an instance of the page is created
                                and the page is converted to HTML format and then the server provides the response and
                                then the instance of the page and the value of the control are destroyed. So if we have
                                a requirement to store the values of the controls and pass them into another web form
                                then a State Management Technique is used.</p>

                            </h4>
                            <p>1) Web architecture is the process of designing, creating and implementing an
                                internet-based
                                computer program. </p>
                            <p>2) The web layer is also referred to as the UI layer. The web layer is primarily
                                concerned
                                with presenting the user interface and the behavior of the application (handling
                                user
                                interactions/events). While the web layer can also contain logic, core application
                                logic is
                                usually located in the services layer.
                            </p>
                            <p>3) The Web layers are logical collections of geographic data that are used to create
                                maps and
                                scenes; they are also the basis for geographic analysis.
                            </p>
                            <p>4) This layer, also called Business Logic or Domain Logic or Application Layer,
                                accepts user
                                requests from the browser, processes them, and determines the routes through which
                                the data
                                will be accessed.
                            </p>
                            <p>5) The user interface layer represents the front end of the vSphere Web Client, and
                                contains
                                the actual GUI elements that users view and click.

                            <h4>B. The three Layers within the Web Layer are: </h4>
                            <p><b>1. HTML-</b>The Content Layer: The content layer is where you store all the
                                content that
                                your
                                customers want to read or look at. This includes text and images as well as
                                multimedia. It's
                                also important to make sure that every aspect of your site is represented in the
                                content
                                layer. That way, your customers who have JavaScript turned off or can't view CSS
                                will still
                                have access to the entire site, if not all the functionality.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>2. CSS -</b> the Styles Layer: Store all your styles for your Web site in an
                                external
                                style
                                sheet. This defines the way the pages should look, and you can have separate style
                                sheets
                                for various media types. Store your CSS in an external style sheet so that you can
                                get the
                                benefits of the style layer across the site.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>3. JavaScript -</b> the Behavior Layer: JavaScript is the most commonly used
                                language for
                                writing
                                the behavior layer; ASP, CGI and PHP can also generate Web page behaviors. However,
                                when
                                most developers refer to the behavior layer, they mean that layer that is activated
                                directly
                                in the Web browser - so JavaScript is nearly always the language of choice. You use
                                this
                                layer to interact directly with the DOM or Document Object Model.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Benefits of separating the layers are: </b><br> Shared resources

                            <p><b>A Tier Technology:</b> is a software architecture in which different software

                            <p>For decades three-tier architecture was the prevailing architecture for client-server
                                applications. Today, most three-tier applications are targets for modernization,
                                using
                                cloud-native technologies such as containers and microservices, and for migration to
                                the
                                cloud.</p>
                            <p>Three layers are involved in the application namely Presentation Layer, Business
                                Layer, and
                                Data Layer. </p>
                            <p><b>The presentation tier:</b> is the user interface and communication layer of the
                                application, where the end user interacts with the application. Its main purpose is
                                to
                                display information to and collect information from the user. This top-level tier
                                can run on
                                a web browser, as desktop application, or a graphical user interface (GUI). Web

                                tiers are usually developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>The application tier (business logic, logic tier, or middle tier): </b>is the
                                heart of the
                                application. In this tier, information collected in the presentation tier is
                                processed -
                                sometimes against other information in the data tier - using business logic, a

                                tier. It is typically developed using Python, Java, Perl, PHP or Ruby, and
                                communicates with
                                the data tier using API calls.

                            <h4>D. Tier vs. layer </h4>
                            <p>In discussions of three-tier architecture, layer is often used interchangeably – and
                                mistakenly – for tier, as in 'presentation layer' or 'business logic layer.'
                                <br>They aren't the same. A 'layer' refers to a functional division of the software,
                                but a
                                'tier' refers to a functional division of the software that runs on infrastructure
                                separate
                                from the other divisions. The Contacts app on your phone, for example, is a
                                three-layer
                                application, but a single-tier application, because all three layers run on your
                                phone.

                                </b><br>The Two-tier architecture is divided into two parts: Client Application
                                (Client
                                Tier), and Database (Data Tier)<br>
                                The client system handles both Presentation and Application layers and the Server
                                system
                                handles the Database layer. The communication takes place between the Client and the
                                Server.
                                The client system sends the request to the server system and the Server system
                                processes the
                                request and sends back the data to the Client System

                                2. Database layer (Data Tier)<br>

                                The client system handles the Presentation layer, the Application server handles the
                                Application layer, and the Server system handles the Database layer.<br>

                                Note: Another layer is the N-Tier application. N-Tier application AKA Distributed
                                application. It is similar to the three-tier architecture but the number of

                            <p>- XML is created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to define a syntax for
                                encoding documents that both humans and machines could read. </p>
                            <p>- XML uses unlimited user defined tags to define the structure of the document as
                                well as how the document should be stored and transported. </p>
                            <p>- XML was designed to store, carry and exchange data. </p>

                            <p>- XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable. </p>
                            <p>- XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags. You must define your own tags.</p>

                            <h4>Features and Uses/ Advantages of XML </h4>
                            <p><b>XML</b> is widely used in the era of web development. It is also used to simplify
                                data storage and data sharing.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>1. XML is an international standard: </b>XML is a document standard that is
                                maintained by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), an organization that is
                                responsible for Web standards. XML documents are vendor-neutral, and they are not
                                tied to one application or one company. </p>
                            <p><b>2. It Separates Data from HTML: </b>If you need to display dynamic data in your
                                HTML document, it will take a lot of work to edit the HTML each time the data
                                changes. With XML, data can be stored in separate XML files. With a few lines of
                                JavaScript code, you can read and external XML files and update the data content of
                                your web pages. </p>
                            <p><b>3. It Simplifies Data Sharing: </b>In the real world, computer systems and
                                databases contain data in incompatible formats. XML data is stored in plain text
                                format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing data. This
                                makes it much easier to create data that can be shared by different applications.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>4. XML Simplifies Data Transport: </b>One of the most time-consuming challenges
                                for developers is to exchange data between incompatible systems over the Internet.
                                Exchanging data as XML greatly reduces this complexity, since the data can be read
                                by different incompatible applications. </p>
                            <p><b>5. It Increases Data Available:</b>Different application can access XML data and
                                can be available to all kinds of “reading machines” (Handheld computers, voice
                                machines, news feeds, etc.) and make it more available for blind people, or people
                                with other disabilities.</p>
                            <p><b>6. XML can be used to create new internet language:</b>A lot of new Internet
                                languages are created with XML: such as
                                <br><u>XHTML:</u> combination of HTML and XML
                                <br><u>WSDL:</u> for describing available web services

                            <p>XML documents are formed as element trees. An XML tree starts at a root element and
                                branches from the root to child elements. The terms parent, child, and sibling are
                                used to describe the relationships between elements. <br>

                            <p><b>1) XML Declaration</b>The XML document can optionally have an XML declaration. It
                                is written as below:</P>
                            <p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding = "UTF-8" ? &gt;</p>
                            <p>This line is also called the XML prolog: Where version is the XML version and
                                encoding specifies the character encoding used in the document.</p>
                            <p><b>Rules for XML Declaration:</b><br>a) The XML declaration is case sensitive and
                                must begin with "
                                &lt;?xml>" where "xml" is written in lower-case.
                                <br>b) If document contains XML declaration, then it strictly needs to be the first
                                statement of the XML document.
                                <br>c) An HTTP protocol can override the value of encoding that you put in the XML
                                declaration.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>2) Tags and Elements</b><br>An XML file is structured by several XML-elements,

                                called XML-nodes or XML-tags. XML-elements' names are enclosed by triangular

                                &lt; element &gt;</p>
                            <p><b>Rules for Tags and Elements:</b><br>
                                a) Each XML-element needs to be closed either with start or with end elements as
                                shown below
                                &lt;element>....&lt;&frasl;element> or in simple-cases, just this way: &lt;element

                                <br>b) There is no limitation and predefined element &frasl; tag name, we can use
                                our own value related name. E.g.: &lt; name> Surendra &lt; &frasl; name>
                                <br>c) If the XML declaration does not have a closing tag, this is not an error. The
                                declaration is not a part of XML.

                                a) Attribute names in XML are case sensitive. That is, HREF and href are considered
                                two different XML attributes.
                                <br>b) Attribute names are defined without quotation marks, whereas attribute values
                                must always appear in quotation marks.
                                <br>Eg. : &lt;name id= “1”>Surendra &lt; &frasl;name>
                            </p>
                            <P><b>4) XML References</b><br>References usually allow you to add or include additional
                                text or markup in an XML document. References always begin with the symbol "&",
                                which is a reserved character and end with the symbol ";". XML has two types of
                                references: </P>
                            <p><b>A. Entity References:</b>Some characters have a special meaning in XML. If you
                                place a character like "&lt;" inside an XML element, it will generate an error
                                because the parser interprets it as the start of a new element.
                                This will generate an XML error:
                                <br>&lt; message> Salary &lt; 1000 &lt; &frasl; message> <br> To avoid this error,
                                replace the "<" character with an entity reference: <br>There are 5 pre-defined
                                    entity
                                    references in XML: <br><img src="/images/charsymbol.JPG" alt=""><b>B. Character

                                    mark (“#”) followed by a number. The number always refers to the Unicode code of
                                    a character. In this case, 65 refers to alphabet "A".
                            </p>
                            <p><b>5) XML Text</b><br>The names of XML-elements and XML-attributes are
                                case-sensitive, which means the name of start and end elements need to be written in
                                the same case.
                                To avoid character encoding problems, all XML files should be saved as Unicode UTF-8
                                or UTF-16 files.
                                Whitespace characters like blanks, tabs and line-breaks between XML-elements and
                                between the XML-attributes will be ignored.

                            <p><b>Comments in XML </b>The syntax for writing comments in XML is similar to that of

                            <h4>XML Namespaces:</h4>
                            <p><b>A Namespace </b>is a set of unique names. Namespace is a mechanism by which
                                element
                                and attribute name can be assigned to group. The Namespace is identified by URI
                                (Uniform
                                Resource Identifiers). A Namespace is declared using reserved attributes. When using
                                prefixes in xml, a namespace for the prefix must be defined; xmlns : prefix = “URI”
                                shown as below:<br>
                                &lt;element xmlns:name="URL"> <br> e.g.: &lt;r : student xmlns : r =
                                “http://www.spt.com.np/xml/”> &lt;/r : student> <br>
                                Elements and attributes name along with namespace have exactly one colon.
                                Colon before text <b>prefix name</b> and colon after text <b>element or attribute
                                    name.</b><br>
                                The Namespace starts with the keyword xmlns.
                                The word name is the Namespace prefix, each prefix name is associated with one URI.
                                <br>
                                The URL is the Namespace identifier. Fully qualified name including prefix, colon is
                                called the XML qualified name.
                                XML data are exchanged between several applications, where may same tag name have
                                different meaning with different applications that make confusion on exchanging
                                documents. So, XML Namespaces is used to distinguish between duplicate elements and
                                attribute names.
                            </p>
                            <p>Namespace affects only a limited area in the document. An element containing the
                                declaration and all of its descendants are in the scope of the Namespace. Following
                                is a
                                simple example of XML Namespace: <br>
                                <br>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
                                <br>&lt;cont:contact xmlns:cont= " http://www.spt.com.np/Profile/">

                                <br>&lt;/cont:contact>
                                <br>Here, the Namespace prefix is cont, and the Namespace identifier (URI) as
                                www.spt.com.np/profile.
                                This means, the element names and attribute names with the cont prefix (including
                                the

                            <h4>DTD (DOCUMENT TYPE DEFINITION) :</h4>
                            <p><b>The XML Document Type Declaration (DTD): </b>is a way to describe XML language
                                precisely. An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed". A DTD
                                defines
                                the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. DTDs check
                                vocabulary and validity of the structure of XML documents against
                                grammatical rules of appropriate XML language. It allows to create rules for the
                                elements within XML document. A DTD defines the document structure with a list of
                                legal
                                elements and attributes. Although XML itself has rules, the rules defined in a DTD
                                are
                                specific to your needs. <br> So, for an XML document to be well-formed, it needs to
                                use
                                correct XML syntax, and it
                                needs to conform to its DTD or schema.
                            </p>
                            <p><i>Note: if you have created your own XML elements, attributes and / or entities,
                                    then
                                    you should create a DTD but if you are creating using predefined elements/
                                    attributes/ entities then a DTD should already exist, and you need only link to
                                    that
                                    DTD using DOCTYPE declaration. </i></p>
                            <p><b>Basic syntax of a DTD is as follows:</b><br>&lt;!DOCTYPE element DTD identifier

                                declaration1 <br>
                                declaration2 <br>
                                ........ <br>
                                ]>
                            </p>
                            <p><b>In the above syntax,</b><br>1. The DTD starts with &lt;!DOCTYPE delimiter.
                                <br>2. An element tells the parser to parse the document from the specified root
                                element.
                                <br>3. DTD identifier is an identifier for the document type definition, which may
                                be
                                the path to a file on the system or URL to a file on the internet. If the DTD is
                                pointing to external path, it is called External Subset.
                                <br>4. The square brackets [ ] enclose an optional list of entity declarations

                                <br>b. Can be defined outside/ inside XML document

                            </p>
                            <p><b>Disadvantages:</b><br>a. They lack some flexibility
                                <br>b. Not writing using XML syntax.

                            <p><b>When NOT to Use a DTD?</b><br>XML does not require a DTD. <br>

                                creating DTDs may be a waste of time. <br>
                                If you develop applications, wait until the specification is stable before you add a
                                DTD. Otherwise, your software might stop working because of validation errors.</p>

                                When declaring a DTD available for public use, you need to use the PUBLIC keyword
                                within
                                your DOCTYPE declaration. When you use the PUBLIC keyword, you also need to use an
                                FPI
                                (which stands for Formal Public Identifier). <br> FPI Syntax: <br>
                                An FPI is made up of 4 fields, each separated by double forward slashes (//): field
                                1//field 2//field 3//field 4 <br>

                            <h4 class="cont">Using control flow to control dynamic content generation</h4>
                            <p><b>Dynamic content</b> in the context of World Wide Web refers to website content
                                that
                                constantly or regularly changes based on user interactions, timing and other
                                parameters
                                that determine what content is delivered to the user. E.g. Facebook site, that
                                delivers
                                dynamic content, as every user gets different content based on their friends and
                                social
                                interactions, although the layout stays generally the same. This could be different
                                text, video, advertisements or even an entirely different layout and color. Dynamic
                                content allows websites to be individually adapted to their visitors. A site uses
                                variety of ways to detect significant user characteristics and matches its contents
                                accordingly.
                                <br><b>Advantages of Dynamic Content are:</b>
                                <br>&emsp;a. It is Personalize:
                                <br>&emsp; b. It is Extensible: it can tap into a variety of external resources
                                including
                                the local
                                file system, databases, or other server.
                                <br>&emsp; c. It is Interactive: provides content and allow to submit information to
                                server.
                                <br>&emsp; d. It is Seamless: can load dynamic content over an already-loaded
                                content.
                            </p>
                            <p><b>There are two ways to provide dynamic content:</b></p>
                            <p><b>1. Using client-side scripting and frameworks</b> such as JavaScript, AJAX and
                                Bootstrap to
                                change the UI behavior within a specific Web page in response to specific user
                                actions
                                and timings. This gives dynamic behavior to the UI presentation. This is normally
                                used
                                in Web applications and interactive websites.
                                <br><b>2. Using server-side scripting and processing</b> to dynamically form both
                                the
                                layout and
                                content to be delivered to the user based on parameters such as the user's location,
                                time of day, browser being used or user preferences. Some good examples of this are
                                social networking sites and content delivery sites. Social networking sites such as
                                Facebook and Twitter provide entirely different content per user because of the
                                difference of their connections and subscribed services, while sites like YouTube
                                and
                                Amazon provide dynamic content based on user-specific preferences based on past
                                purchases or views; the server gives suggested items or content that the user may
                                like
                                based on historical data.

                                then the instance of the page and the value of the control are destroyed. So if we
