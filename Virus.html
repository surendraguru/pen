                            connection: is a temporary connection, set up between your computer and ISP (Internet
                            Service Provider). It uses a modem which uses telephone line to dial up the number of ISP
                            server.
                            <br>b. Through Broadband Connection: is a high bandwidth connection to the Internet. It is
                            easier and faster to use and it can be provided over phone line, via cable or via satellite.
                            Some Standard broadband technologies are: ISDN, ADSL, Cable net etc.
                            <br>c. Through Wireless Connection: Wireless broadband internet service provides the ability
                            to access the internet wirelessly from any location within the service's coverage area.
                            Wireless Internet is delivered through radio waves or satellite signals. Two most common
                            ways to connect to the Internet wirelessly are:
                            <br>1. WiFi (Wireless Fidelity): is a popular wireless networking technology that uses radio
                            waves to provide wireless high-speed connections. It operates at a frequency of 2.4GHz. The
                            requirement of WiFi are:
                            <br>i. Broadband Internet connection
                            <br>ii. Wireless router
                            <br>iii. Computer with wireless card/adapter
                            <br>2. WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access): is a standard for high-speed
                            broadband Internet access over a wireless connection. It can be used to provide fast and
                            free Internet access to entire cities up to 50 kilometers using towers.

<b></b>The stored program concept states that a computer's program and data are stored in the computer's memory, and 
                            the computer can access and execute them as needed. This concept allows the computer to modify its own program,

<b></b>The stored program concept enables general-purpose computing, where a single computer can perform a wide range of tasks.

                        <h4>Stored Program Concept</h4>
                        <p><b>Stored Program Concept: </b> is a fundamental idea in computer architecture that revolutionized the way computers process information. 
                            It was first introduced by John von Neumann in the 1940s.</b>
<b></b>The stored program concept states that a computer's program and data are stored in the computer's memory, and 
                            the computer can access and execute them as needed. This concept allows the computer to modify its own program, 
                            enabling dynamic changes to the program during execution.</b>
<b></b>The stored program concept enables general-purpose computing, where a single computer can perform a wide range of tasks. 
                            It has also led to the development of more powerful and efficient computers, which have transformed the way we live and work.</b>
