                        <p><b> There are mainly three ways to connect to the Internet: </b> <br>a. Through Dial-up
                            connection: is a temporary connection, set up between your computer and ISP (Internet
                            Service Provider). It uses a modem which uses telephone line to dial up the number of ISP
                            server.
                            <br>b. Through Broadband Connection: is a high bandwidth connection to the Internet. It is
                            easier and faster to use and it can be provided over phone line, via cable or via satellite.
                            Some Standard broadband technologies are: ISDN, ADSL, Cable net etc.
                            <br>c. Through Wireless Connection: Wireless broadband internet service provides the ability
                            to access the internet wirelessly from any location within the service's coverage area.
                            Wireless Internet is delivered through radio waves or satellite signals. Two most common
                            ways to connect to the Internet wirelessly are:
                            <br>1. WiFi (Wireless Fidelity): is a popular wireless networking technology that uses radio
                            waves to provide wireless high-speed connections. It operates at a frequency of 2.4GHz. The
                            requirement of WiFi are:
                            <br>i. Broadband Internet connection
                            <br>ii. Wireless router
                            <br>iii. Computer with wireless card/adapter
                            <br>2. WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access): is a standard for high-speed
                            broadband Internet access over a wireless connection. It can be used to provide fast and
                            free Internet access to entire cities up to 50 kilometers using towers.

                        <h4>Stored Program Concept</h4>
                        <p><b>Stored Program Concept: </b> is a fundamental idea in computer architecture that revolutionized the way computers process information. 
                            It was first introduced by John von Neumann in the 1940s.
The stored program concept states that a computer's program and data are stored in the computer's memory, and 
                            the computer can access and execute them as needed. This concept allows the computer to modify its own program, 
                            enabling dynamic changes to the program during execution.
The stored program concept enables general-purpose computing, where a single computer can perform a wide range of tasks. 
                            It has also led to the development of more powerful and efficient computers, which have transformed the way we live and work.

<br>â€¢	Represents data by punching holes in predefined positions on cards 
<br>â€¢	Each card can store fixed amount of data 
<br>â€¢	Programs were written on punch cards 
<br>â€¢	Each card contained one line of code, and the sequence of cards formed the complete program 
<br>â€¢	Punch cards led to development of more advanced data storage and processing methods, including magnetic tapes and disks 
<br>â€¢	To read the data on punch cards, the card is inserted into the card reader which has a mechanism to hold the card in place securely. 
    <br>                        â€¢	The presence of holes or the absence of holes is detected by the card reader which uses sensors. 
<br>â€¢	Each position corresponds to a bit of data in punch cards. 
<br>â€¢	The binary data read from card is processed accordingly.

                        <h4>Communication modes </h4>
                        <p><b>Communication modes : </b> refer to the various ways in which information is exchanged between 
                            individuals, groups, or organizations. In communication systems, there are three primary modes of 
                            communication: Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex. Simplex mode is one-way communication, 
                            Half-Duplex mode is two-way communication with alternating transmission, and Full-Duplex mode is 
                            two-way communication with simultaneous transmission and reception.</p>
<p><b>1. Simplex Mode</b>
<br>â€¢	One-way communication, where only one party can transmit information.
<br>â€¢	The other party can only receive information and cannot respond.
<br>â€¢	Examples: Radio broadcasting, television, and a loudspeaker. </p>
<p><b>2. Half-Duplex Mode</b>
<br>â€¢	Two-way communication, but only one party can transmit at a time.
<br>â€¢	The parties take turns transmitting and receiving information.
<br>â€¢	Examples: Walkie-talkies, citizen's band (CB) radios, and some satellite communications.</p>
<p><b>3. Full-Duplex Mode</b>
<br>â€¢	Two-way communication, where both parties can transmit and receive information simultaneously.
<br>â€¢	Both parties can talk and listen at the same time.
<br>â€¢	Examples: Telephone conversations, video conferencing, and most modern computer networks.</p>
